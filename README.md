# ES-CCGAN, the implementation of the paper of "Unsupervised Haze Removal for High-Resolution Optical Remote-Sensing Images Based on Improved Generative Adversarial Networks", the link of this paper is "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/24/4162".
This is a remote sensing image dehazing code, and this is realized by python.
To run this project you need to set up the environment, download the dataset, run a script to process data, and then you can train and test the network models. 
I will show you step by step to run this project and I hope it is clear enough.

--Prerequisite
I tested my project in Intel Core i9, 64G RAM, GPU RTX 2080 Ti. Because it takes about several days for training, I recommend you using CPU/GPU strong enough and about 24G Video Memory.

--Dataset
I use a self-made remote sensing image which consists of 52376 haze-free images, 52376 hazy images, and 52376 haze-free images with blurred edges. All the images were 256 Ã— 256 pixels in size. All of the data need to transform to tfrecords. The code of generated haze remote sensing image is in the "ImageFogger.py" 

--Training
To train a generator, run the following command
python train.py

--Test
First, the model needs to transform to  the type of '.pb', run the following command
python export_graph.py
Second, the haze image is dehazed as following:
python inference.py
